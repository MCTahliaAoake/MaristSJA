              <h2>What is Senior Vinnie's?</h2>
              <p>Senior Vinnie's is an awesome group that involves year 11-13 students. As a group, we learn about and brainstorm inventive ways of helping the disadvantaged in our community. We are heavily focused on bringing awareness of the present issues in our society and part of achieving that is by giving back to people from all and any backgrounds. We aim on upholding the dignity of the less fortunate through our acts of love, compassion, and service.</p>
