              <h2>What is Senior Vinnie's?</h2>
              <p>Senior Vinnie's is an awesome group that involves year 11-13 students. As a group, we learn about and brainstorm inventive ways of helping the disadvantaged in our community. We are heavily focused on bringing awareness of the present issues in our society and part of achieving that is by giving back to people from all and any backgrounds. We aim on upholding the dignity of the less fortunate through our acts of love, compassion, and service.</p>
              <h2>How does Senior Vinnies have an impact on our society?</h2>
              <p>Senior Vinnies try to make physical and knowledgeable impacts on our society, by getting involved in hands on projects that help those in our community with projects such as, life drive, cans for Christmas, volunteering at the food bank and other initiatives. We also work hard to educate our school and wider community to understand the issues facing people in our community.</p>
